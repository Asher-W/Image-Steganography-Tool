# To-do

Ordered (mostly) by priority

## Code

- [ ] Create and release executable version of project
- [ ] Tkinter currently not included in requirements.txt, as it cannot simply be installed with pip. Solution needed
- [ ] Fix spelling errors and reformat for readability
- [ ] Properly format code as packages and modules (\_\_main\_\_.py, \_\_init\_\_.py, and if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_', ...)
- [ ] Create example of tool being used

## Documentation

- [ ] Create usage instructions
- [ ] Create build from source instructions

## Suggestions

- [ ] Rename project; "EncryptionEncoder" doesn't really make sense - Jakob
